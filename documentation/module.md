# Ktor PostgreSQL Docker Clean Architecture API

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Ktor PostgreSQL Docker Clean Architecture API**, a production-ready RESTful service built with a modern Kotlin technology stack.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive blueprint for building scalable, maintainable, and testable backend systems using industry best practices. It demonstrates the power of combining a lightweight, asynchronous web framework with a robust architectural pattern and modern deployment strategies.

### Core Architecture

The system is designed around the principles of **Clean Architecture**, which ensures a clear separation of concerns between different layers of the application:
-   **Domain Layer:** Contains pure business logic, entities, and use cases, with zero external dependencies.
-   **Data Layer:** Implements data persistence and retrieval using Exposed ORM and PostgreSQL.
-   **Presentation Layer:** Handles HTTP requests and responses using the Ktor framework.

This layered approach makes the system highly testable, flexible, and independent of external frameworks and technologies.

### Key Technologies

-   **Web Framework:** [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) - A modern, asynchronous framework for building microservices and web applications in Kotlin.
-   **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - An enterprise-grade, open-source relational database.
-   **ORM:** [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) - A type-safe SQL library for Kotlin from JetBrains.
-   **Dependency Injection:** [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) - A pragmatic and lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.
-   **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - For building, shipping, and running the application in isolated containers.
-   **Configuration:** [HOCON](https://github.com/lightbend/config) & [Dotenv](https://github.com/cdimascio/dotenv-kotlin) - For unified, type-safe configuration across all environments.
